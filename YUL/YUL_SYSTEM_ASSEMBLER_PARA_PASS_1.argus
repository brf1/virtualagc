R2900   PARAPROGRAM RD1 -- PASS 1 -- GROUP B
R2901   ====================================

R2902              THIS PARAPROGRAM IS OPERATED BY GROUP B DURING PASS 1 AND READS SYPT, SYLT, AND BYPT RECORDS FROM
R2904   TAPE 1 (SYSTEM TAPE).  IT CLASSIFIES SYPT AND SYLT RECORDS INTO DELETE, SAVE, AND INPUT RECORDS.  SAVE RECORDS
R2906   ARE SIMPLY PASSED OVER UNTIL THE FIRST DELETE OR INPUT RECORD IS ENCOUNTERED.  THEREAFTER, SAVE RECORDS ARE
R2908   TRANSMITTED TO BE WRITTEN ON TAPE 3 BY A PROGRAM IN GROUP C.  IN A PROGRAM ASSEMBLY, ALL SYLTSAVES ARE TRANS-
R2910   MITTED.  BYPT RECORDS ARE CLASSIFIED INTO DELETE OR SAVE RECORDS, BYPTSAVES BEING TRANSMITTED TO BE WRITTEN ON
R2912   TAPE 4.  IN EACH FILE, THOSE RECORDS ARE DELETED WHOSE NAMES ARE THREADED FOR DELETION IN THE YUL FILE.  ALSO,
R2914   IN A PROGRAM ASSEMBLY, ANY EXISTING LOAD DECK (BYPT RECORD) FOR THE PROGRAM BEING ASSEMBLED IS DELETED.  THERE
R2916   ARE INPUT RECORDS FROM SYPT DURING A PROGRAM RE-ASSEMBLY, AND THERE ARE INPUT RECORDS FROM SYLT DURING A SUBROU-
R2918   TINE RE-ASSEMBLY OR WHENEVER SUBROUTINES ARE USED.  THE FINAL TASK OF RD1 IS TO POSITION TAPE 1 CORRECTLY FOR
R2920   WRITING DURING PASS 2.  SYLT RECORDS THAT ARE INPUT (EXCEPT BELONGING TO THE PRINCIPAL IN SUBROUTINE ASSEMBLY)
R2922   ARE ALSO SAVED, TO PERMIT ONE-SHOT MODIFICATION OF SUBROUTINES.

R2923   A "PARAPROGRAM" IS A SUBSIDIARY ROUTINE RUNNING IN A SIDE GROUP.  WE ARE INDEBTED AS USUAL TO JOHN SHAW FOR
R29232  JSOCTL
